## ‚ùì About

Magma is the next generation of hybrid minecraft server softwares.

Magma is based on **Forge and Spigot**, meaning it can run both **CraftBukkit/Spigot plugins and Forge mods**.

## üåê BungeeCord/Velocity

Magma 1.20.1 is **not** compatible with **vanilla** BungeeCord or any of its forks. This is **caused by Forge** and not a fault of Magma. We cannot fix this ourselves without modifying the client.
You might be able to use the Waterfall fork called [Lightfall](https://github.com/ArclightPowered/lightfall), but it also requires a clientside-mod in order to work and is not officially supported.

Magma 1.20.1 is **not** compatible with **vanilla** [Velocity](https://velocitypowered.com/downloads/). This is **caused by Forge** and not a fault of Magma. We cannot fix this ourselves without modifying the client and the proxy.
